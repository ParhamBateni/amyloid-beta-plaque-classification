DATA ORGANIZATION ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=====================================

✅ DATA ORGANIZATION IS CORRECT
- All 9 classes have corresponding folders
- Image counts match between data table and folders
- All images are 224x224 RGB PNG format
- No missing or corrupted files detected

CLASS DISTRIBUTION:
- CAA: 74 samples (Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy)
- Coarse: 79 samples (Coarse plaques)
- Compact: 63 samples (Compact plaques)  
- Cored: 107 samples (Cored plaques) - LARGEST CLASS
- Diffuse: 81 samples (Diffuse plaques)
- NonAB: 38 samples (Non-amyloid beta) - SMALLEST CLASS
- OtherAB: 31 samples (Other amyloid beta)
- Subpial: 73 samples (Subpial plaques)
- UndefAB: 43 samples (Undefined amyloid beta)

TOTAL: 589 labeled samples across 9 classes

SAMPLE IMAGES SAVED:
- Location: sample_images_by_class/
- 3 sample images per class (27 total)
- Each image includes metadata (roundness, area, index)
- HTML grid view: sample_images_grid.html

VISUAL INSPECTION NEEDED:
1. Open sample_images_grid.html in your web browser
2. Look for visual patterns that distinguish each class
3. Check if images within each class look similar
4. Verify that different classes have distinct characteristics
5. Note any potential mislabeling issues

EXPECTED VISUAL PATTERNS:
- CAA: Blood vessel wall deposits
- Cored: Dense central cores with surrounding material
- Diffuse: Widespread, less dense deposits
- Compact: Dense, well-defined structures
- Coarse: Large, irregular deposits
- Subpial: Deposits beneath brain surface
- NonAB: Non-amyloid pathological structures
- OtherAB: Other amyloid types
- UndefAB: Unclassified amyloid deposits

TRAINING IMPLICATIONS:
- Class imbalance exists (31-107 samples per class)
- Model should handle this with class weights or balanced sampling
- Visual patterns should be learnable by CNN architecture
- 224x224 resolution is appropriate for detailed analysis
